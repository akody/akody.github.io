I am a Maria Goeppert Mayer Postdoctoral Fellow at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/) in Lemont, Illinois in the Energy Systems and Infrastructure Analysis Division. My research focuses on developing control and optimization algorithms for power and energy systems. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in 2019, where my thesis was on developing control systems for self-powered technologies. My graduate work was supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Program and a Rackham Merit Fellowship. Contact me at [akody@anl.gov](mailto:akody@anl.gov).
