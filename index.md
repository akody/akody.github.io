I am a [Maria Goeppert Mayer Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.anl.gov/article/argonnes-2021-maria-goeppert-mayer-fellows-bring-new-energy-promise-to-their-fields) at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/) in Lemont, Illinois in the Energy Systems and Infrastructure Analysis Division. My research focuses on developing control and optimization algorithms for power and energy systems. I was recently named a [2022 Rising Star in EECS](https://risingstars.utexas.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in 2019, where my thesis was on developing control systems for energy harvesting devices. My graduate work was supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Program and a Rackham Merit Fellowship. Contact me at [akody@anl.gov](mailto:akody@anl.gov).

### **Other Interests**

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking and other outdoor activities, like cross-country skiing and biking. Here are photos from some of my favorite places I've visited over the last few years:

 Maybe you can guess these locations. Hints: Two are outside of the US. Two were taken in US National Parks.
