Welcome! I am currently a Maria Goeppert Mayer Postdoctoral Fellow at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/) in Lemont, Illinois. My research focuses on developing control and optimization algorithms for power and energy systems. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in 2019, where my thesis was on developing control systems for self-powered technologies. My graduate work was supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and a Rackham Merit Fellowship. You can contact me at [akody@anl.gov](mailto:akody@anl.gov).
